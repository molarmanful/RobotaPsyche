# Presentation Summary

For my presentation, I presented on the various ways in which religion and robotics have intertwined over the course of human history. From the ancient Greek tales of the mythological bronze automaton Talos, to the clockwork contraptions of the Islamic Golden Age, to the mechanical advancements of the Renaissance and Descartes' treatises on life as machinery, I showed the various ways in which humans have grappled with the idea of creating artificial life. For the Greeks, *biotechne* - "life through craft" - implied that creating robots was divine, an act meant for the gods. Alongside *biotechne* is the idea of theomorphic robots. God created humans in His image; we create robots in our image; therefore, it might be argued that we are self-attributing divinity through the creation of robots. Along these lines, we discussed:

- Whether humans create humanoid robots out of ego - "playing God" - or the need for familiarity.
- Whether humans are capable of worshipping robots, and what a robot-centric religion might entail.
- Whether it is morally acceptable to make robots worship humans.
