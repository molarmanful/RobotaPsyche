# Discussion Summary

I worked with Phillip to lead a discussion on Isaac Asimov's "Reason," a story about a robotic spaceship assistant whose disobedient attitude and staunch belief in a higher being initially causes misunderstandings and disapproval among its human caretakers. However, as the plot progresses, the humans discover that the robot's belief in what it calls the "Maker" actually allows it to perform its initial object better than the human crew. "Reason" provides a unique insight into the priority-based property of Asimov's proposed Three Laws of Robotics, and demonstrates an instance of how the ability to disobey humans might end up being indirectly beneficial or necessary to complete human-given tasks.

Our discussions covered several points of contention. First was the issue of whether it is worth implementing or allowing disobedience in the intelligent robots we may create in the future, and whether it is safe to put our faith in real-life implementations of the Laws of Robotics. The second part of our discussion explored how robot religions might operate, and grappled with the question of whether giving robots belief in a higher order would have unintended consequences for humans.
